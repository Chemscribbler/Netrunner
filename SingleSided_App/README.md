# Side Aware Swiss Software (SASS)

## A tournament manager app designed for Netrunner tournaments

This app is meant to be an interactive application for tournament managers to seamlessly run single sided (or double sided if they're feeling perverse) locally on their machine.

This is an early version, so many features will be missing. Most importantly hand re-pairings, and top cuts are not implemented at all, but are on the list of features. Additionally the tournament import/export is very basic, and is not an easily parsable log of what occurred. Eventually I want to make the export [Always Be Running](https://alwaysberunning.net/) compatible.


If you have feature requests, it's probably best to reach me on [Stimslack](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fstimslackinvite.herokuapp.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGcS166Mr8z-H0l4RcoGM43C_dc5w) as Ysengrin. Bugs/feature requests/emails will be checked, but less consistently.
