## Single Sided Swiss
This event will be single sided swiss. The rational for why and how can was written about [here](https://stimhack.com/single-sided-swiss-how-it-works-by-ysengrin/). On the day this will function like a regular tournament. Every round you will get a pairing, where you will be assigned both an opponent and a side. Please play only the assigned side. Every round you will be matched to people close in strength of schedule and in a way to minimize the number of people with uneven sides. Rematches can occur, but should always be with you playing the opposite decks from your first match.

A win in single sided swiss is 3 points, a tie is 1 point, and a loss is 0 points. If you and your opponent agree to a tie, please alert a TO within the first 5 minutes of the round.
