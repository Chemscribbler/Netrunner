There are few different things to test and investigate

Implement current swiss- random pairings within group
Implement high-low swiss - top player in each score group plays bottom player
Implement Almafi- Each player plays down place - R (R is rounds remaining number)


Separately investigate single sided swiss
If we split players in Runner then Corp and Corp then Runner does that heavily skew results?
To test pre-generate players with a given strength, and a corp winrate of 65-75% and compare
forced side vs strength and coin-flip
