# GLC Startup Tournament - New Players Encouraged

This tournament will be using Nisei's new Startup format. That means all legal decks must be built out of System Gateway + System Update 21 + Ashes (the most recently released cycle). All decks must follow deck construction rules.

The start time will be [10 AM PST](https://time.is/Los_Angeles), with a player meeting at 9:45. The tournament will be run using a single sided swiss system, so in every round you will be assigned your opponent and which deck you will play. You might have a rematch with that person, but it will be with the deck you did not play in the previous match.

## Registration

Please register [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1XYeIidJ0xXI8gGNFwyc79ll_1J71JB5-QUGYBkykjo0/edit)

To register you must have both a runner and corporation deck. Decklists are not required at the time of registration (though ID choices are).

## Tournament Policies
This event will follow all Nisei OP Tournament policies, most important the code of conduct.

> Project NISEl is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of belief, body size, disability (learning, mental, physical or any other kind), gender identity and expression, health conditions (mental or physical), physical appearance, race, religion or sexual orientation. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

Because this is a new player focussed tournament, this will be run as a casual event. That means we strongly encourage you to allow players to give takebacks (exceptions for drawing/accessing cards- both of which reveal new information are reasonable). If you have any questions about an interaction please contact a judge. Jinteki.net is a very good tool, but its impementation does not always exactly match the rules, so if something seems unintuitive, please call a judge! Calling judges when you got questions about a rule, or what a card does is what they are there for.

Another important leg to stand on here is to be respectful of your opponent. We want to make sure the Netrunner community continues to be a welcoming space. If your opponent is making/made you feel uncomfortable, please reach out to a judge and we will help you resolve the issue.

Because this is a new player tournament judges will be lenient with slow play calls, but if you do feel your opponent it intentionally slowing down the game to gain a benefit, please do reach out to a judge.

## Decklists

Every played must bring two legal decks, one Corporation, one Runner. Submission/claiming decklists is encouraged. If deckbuilding is intimidating (as is often true for a new cardpool) the following decklist below can be run as is, or modified by you. Each one is tournament legal, and can be exported to [Jinteki.net](jinteki.net) by selecting Actions > Export Jinteki.net and then copying and pasting. Or by using Jinteki.net's built in auto-import. To do that import copy the numbers that appear in the url after netrunnerdb.com/en/decklist/#####/....
